# GitHub-Commits-Faker

## Introduction

This project provides a script for generating fake GitHub commits for testing purposes. Please note that using this code is at your own risk.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14-20.4)

## Setup

1. **Fork the repository:**

   Fork this repository to your own GitHub account. Click the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of this page.

2. **Clone the forked repository using Visual Studio Code:**

   Open Visual Studio Code and click on the "View" menu, then select "Command Palette" (or use the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+P`). Type "Git: Clone" and select it.

   Enter the URL of your forked repository (replace `your-username` with your GitHub username):

   ```bash
   https://github.com/your-username/Github-Commits-Faker.git
   ```
2. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
   cd Github-Commits-Faker
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
   npm install
   ```
## Usage
To start generating fake commits, run the following command:
 ```bash
   npm run setup
   # or
   npm run start
```
This will initiate the script to create random commits at intervals. The commit data will be written to a data.json file, and the commits will be pushed to the repository.

## Warning
This code is intended for testing purposes only. Using this code in a real or production environment may have unintended consequences. Always use caution and be aware of the potential risks associated with fake data.
